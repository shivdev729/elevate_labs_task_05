# ðŸ“„ Task 5 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship
# Network Traffic Capture and Protocol Analysis

#### **Tools Used**

* **Wireshark** â€“ For packet capture and analysis

#### **Steps Followed**

1. **Install Wireshark**  
   Download from [https://www.wireshark.org/](https://www.wireshark.org/) and install it.

2. **Start Packet Capture**  
   Open Wireshark and select your active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi). Click the blue shark fin icon to begin capture.

3. **Generate Traffic**  
   Browse websites or ping a server to create network activity. Let the capture run for about 1 minute.

4. **Stop the Capture**  
   Click the red square stop icon. Save the file as `wifi1.pcapng`.

5. **Filter and Identify Protocols**  
   Use Wiresharkâ€™s filter (e.g., `arp`, `quic`, `icmpv6`, `dns`) to identify protocols in use.

6. **Analyze Packets**  
   Review packet details for protocol behavior, source/destination, and message types.

7. **Generate the Report**  
   A structured `.pdf` report was generated summarizing the findings.
